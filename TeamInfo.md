## Project Summary

Our project consists of a large iMDb database and a YouTube database. Users will be able to look at a certain movie within the database, and with that movie there will be related videos on YouTube that are also trending. 
We would like to give users a platform to view trending videos associated with movies. This will give the user an idea of when movies are trending and additionally the videos themselves can give the user an idea of the aspects of the movies that people are most excited about. 
Our application would allow a user to select a movie/ TV show and learn how many trending videos related to it existed within a chosen region during the duration it appeared in the titles and tags of trending videos. It would allow the user to be able to identify when these movies seemed to be most popular and draw conclusions based on the reception it seemed to receive on the internet.
